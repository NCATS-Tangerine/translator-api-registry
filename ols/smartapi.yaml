  title: Ontology Lookup Service API
  description: >-
    The OLS REST API provides access to key biological data from OLS.
    The services provide a unified interface to query information about ontology terms
    from GO (the Gene Ontology) and ECO (the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology), Gene
    Ontology annotations from the EBI's GOA database, and gene products (proteins
    from UniProt, RNA from RNAcentral and complexes from ComplexPortal).
    See https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/docs/api for more details.
