properties:

  metadata:
    description: Relative path to the smartAPI yaml description of the API in the translator-api-registry repo.

  translator:
    
    apiName:
      description: A name for the API.
      type: string
      example: "Monarch-Biolink API"
      insmartAPI: true
 
    accessURL:
      description: The URL where the API service/endpoint can be programmatically accessed/queried.
      type: string
      format: url
      example: "https://api.monarchinitiative.org/api/"
      insmartAPI: true
    
    serviceType:
      description: Whether the API provides data or computational services (i.e. does it serve pre-indexed data in response to a user query, or does it perform computation on input data to generate novel output)
      type:  array
      items:  [data, computation] ($ENUM1)
      example: '[data]'
      insmartAPI: false

    description:
      description: Brief free-text description of content/scope of data served by the API, and the source/provenance of the data. Can include a link to existing documentation.
      type: string
      example: "The Biolink API serves data from a neo4j graph database holding semantically integrated data from a variety of biological/biomedical community databases, with a focus on genotype-phenotype related resources. Most data represents manually-curated knowledge derived from the published literature or research studies. For more see https://monarchinitiative.org/page/about."
      insmartAPI: true

    dataLevel:
      description: The general category/level of data provided or operated on by the API.  For definitions of allowable values, see description in VALUE SET ENUMERATIONS section below.
      type:  array 
      items: [experimental data, computed data, curated data, EHR/patient data, ontologies] ($ENUM2)
      example: '[curated data]'
      insmartAPI: false

     primarySources:  	
      description: This field is relevant only for APIs that serve data aggregated from external sources (e.g. Biothings, Biolink, Wikidata), or that compute over data from external sources to generate outputs served by the API (e.g. BigGIM). In this field, provide the names of all such external knowledge sources, or a link to documentation listing such sources. 
      type: string
      format: comma separated list of source names, or link to external list
      example: "MGI, ZFIN, ClinVar"
      example: "See list at https://monarchinitiative.org/about/sources"
      insmartAPI: false
 
    entityTypes:
      description: The types of entities described by data provided or operated on by the API.
      type: array 
      items: For allowable values here, see ENUM3 in the VALUE SET ENUMERATIONS section below ($ENUM3)
      example: '[Gene, Disease, Phenotype]'
      insmartAPI: false
 
    entityAssociations:
  	  description: If the API returns 'associations' between domain entities, list pairs of entity types that are directly connected in the data it serves. These associations can be curated relationships with defined semantics (e.g. Biolink, Wikidata), or computed statistical associations with weighted edges (e.g. BigGIM). If desired, a specific type of relationship between the associated entities can be described parenthetically after the entity pair, as can a specific role played by one of the entities in the association. See examples below. 
      type: array 
      items: hyphen-separated pairs of terms, each of which is an entity type from $ENUM3. And optionally, a parenthetical description of the relationship described between the entities, or a role played by one of the entities). Note that the entity associations here are defiend without regard to a direction to the relationship, so [Gene - Phenotype] is equivalent to [Phenotype - Gene]. 
      example: [Gene - Phenotype, Gene - Disease, Disease - Phenotype, Drug - Protein]
      # Examples where type of relationship, or a role played by the target entity, is indicated parenthetically.
      example: '[Gene - Gene (homology)]'
      example: '[Gene - Gene (interaction)]'
      example: '[Gene - Gene (co-expressed with)]'
      example: '[Drug - Protein (drug target)]'
      example: '[Drug - Phenotype (side effect)]'
      insmartAPI: false

    entityAttributes:
      description:  The types of attributes or data that an API returns about the entities it describes. Captured as 'entity - attribute' pairs that describe a link between an entity type and some data item about them (e.g. 'Allele - frequency', or 'Patient - exposure score'), as opposed associations between two entity types as captured by the entityAssociationTypes field.
      type: array
      items: hyphen-separated pairs of terms. The first is an entity type from $ENUM3, and the second is a user-defined attribute or data type.
      example: '[Variant/Allele - frequency]'
      example: '[SequenceFeature - sequence, SequenceFeature - genomic position, Gene - conservation score]' 
      example: '[Patient - exposure score]'
      insmartAPI: false

    translatorTeam:
      description: Translator team(s) that generated or manage the API/Service.
      type: array 
      items: [Purple, Orange, Green, Blue, Grey, Red, External]  ($ENUM4)
      example: '[Orange]'
      insmartAPI: false

    termsOfService:
      description:  URL linking to to a description of the terms of service for the API, including intended use and disclaimers. 
      type: string
      format: url 
      example: "http://mygene.info/terms/"
      insmartAPI: true

    accessRestriction:
      description: whether there are restrictions to using the API.
      type: array
      items: [none, limited, fee] ($ENUM5)
      example: [none]
      insmartAPI: true

    license:
      description: The name of a specific license for data served by the API, or link to web page describing licensing information.
      type: string
      example: "CC-BY-3.0"
      insmartAPI: true (but captured as a License Object with name and url properties)

    returrnsjson:
      description: Whether the  API returns  data in JSON format.
      type: boolean
      example: 'true'
      insmartAPI: false

    notes:
      description: Any other important information or nuance not adequately captured in the fields above.
      type: string
      example: "Biolink does not yet serve entity-attribute data that is captured in its underlying Monarch database, but will do so in the near future. This includes Variant/Allele - frequency data, and SequenceFeature - genomic position data"
      insmartAPI: false

# VALUE SET ENUMERATIONS
  # Further description of the five value sets defined above are provided below.
  # Note that the boolean 'extensible' field indicates if/how users are able to extend value sets with new terms.  
  # A 'true' value indicates that any user can extend as needed without review/vetting by others (i.e. directly edit and commit the value set in this document). A 'false' indicates a closed value set where the addition of new terms must be vetted by the wider community (i.e. post a issue in the Github tracker requesting the new value, or submit proposed changes via a pull request).
