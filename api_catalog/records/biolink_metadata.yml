      description: "The Biolink API serves data from the Monarch Initiative SciGraph database - a neo4j database holding semantically integrated data from a variety of biological/biomedical community databases, with a focus on genotype-phenotype related resources. Most data represents manually-curated knowledge derived from the published literature or research studies. For more see https://monarchinitiative.org/page/about."
