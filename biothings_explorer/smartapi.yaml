    operations:
    ## look at https://standards.ncats.io/operation.json for details.
    ## could use lookup_and_score in the future?
      - lookup
    ## no batch_size_limit (BTE manages IDs for QNodes and sub-queries internally)
    ## /query endpoints have a limit of 15 requests/client/min
    ## /meta_knowledge_graph endpoints have a limit of 30 requests/client/min
    ## other endpoints don't have rate limits
    rate_limit: 15

servers:
## ITRB Production and Test are deployed manually, based on the staging instance
## ITRB CI / staging is basically deployed manually, from main branches
## - automatic for updates in bte-trapi-workspace main branch, but those rarely happen
## - we could technically control what branches are used (but right now we don't do this)
## non-ITRB dev: total manual control on updates (what branches of modules are used for updates)

    Attribute:
      type: object
      description: >-
        Generic attribute for a node or an edge that expands the key-value
        pair concept by including fields for additional metadata. These fields
        can be used to describe the source of the statement made in a key-value
        pair of the attribute object, or describe the attribute's value itself
        including its semantic type, or a url providing additional information
        about it. An attribute may be further qualified with sub-attributes
        (for example to provide confidence intervals on a value).

            The 'key' of the attribute object, holding a CURIE of an ontology
            property defining the attribute (preferably the CURIE of a
            Biolink association slot). This property captures the relationship
            asserted to hold between the value of the attribute, and the node
            or edge from  which it hangs. For example, that a value of
            '0.000153' represents a p-value supporting an edge, or that
            a value of 'ChEMBL' represents the original source of the knowledge
            expressed in the edge.

            a column name in a source tsv file, or a key in a source json
            document for the field in the data that held the attribute's
            value. Capturing this information  where possible lets us preserve
            what the original source said. Note that the data type is string'

            If appropriate, it SHOULD be the term name of the CURIE used

            readability.

            Relationship between the database value and the constraint value

            is equal to, is greater than, and is less than,
            respectively. The 'matches' operator indicates that the value
            is a regular expression to be evaluated. If value is a list type,
            then at least one evaluation must be true (equivalent to OR).
            This means that the == operator with a list acts like a SQL 'IN'
            clause. If the value of the compared attribute is a list, then
            comparisons are performed between each of the constraint values
            and each of the attribute values, and any one true evaluation
            counts as an overall true (e.g., [1,2,3] == [6,7,2] is true).
            The == operator is therefore a broad interpretation of inclusion.
            The '===' operator requires that the constraint value and
            the attribute value be the same data type, length,
            content, and order (e.g. only [1,2,3] === [1,2,3]).
            The 'not' property negates the operator such that not
            and == means 'not equal to' (or 'not in' for a list), and not >
            means <=, and not < means >=, not matches means does not
            match, and not === means the match between the constraint
            and attribute values are not exact.
            The '==' operator SHOULD NOT be used in a manner that
            describes an "is a" subclass relationship for the parent QNode.

            operator is used. If 'value' is of data
            type 'object', the keys of the object MAY be treated as a list.
            A 'list' data type paired with the '>' or '<' operators will
