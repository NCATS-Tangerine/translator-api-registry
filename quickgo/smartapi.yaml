  title: QuickGO API
  description: >-
    The QuickGO REST API provides access to key biological data from QuickGO
    and GOA. The services provide a unified interface to query information about ontology
    terms from GO (the Gene Ontology) and ECO (the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology),
    Gene Ontology annotations from the EBI's GOA database, and gene products (proteins
    from UniProt, RNA from RNAcentral and complexes from ComplexPortal).
    See https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/api/index.html for more details.
